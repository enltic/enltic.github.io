[00:03.42]Lyrics by：Fool's Garden

[00:10.26]Arranged by：Fool's Garden
[00:13.68]I&apos;m sittin&apos; here in the boring room
[00:16.94]It&apos;s just another rainy Sunday afternoon
[00:20.26]I&apos;m wastin&apos; my time I got nothin&apos; to do
[00:23.64]I&apos;m hangin&apos; around I&apos;m waitin&apos; for you
[00:26.81]But nothing ever happens and I wonder
[00:33.92]I&apos;m drivin&apos; around in my car
[00:37.10]I&apos;m drivin&apos; too fast I&apos;m drivin&apos; too far
[00:40.50]I&apos;d like to change my point of view
[00:43.72]I feel so lonely I&apos;m waitin&apos; for you
[00:46.91]But nothing ever happens and I wonder
[00:54.11]I wonder how I wonder why
[00:57.30]Yesterday you told me &apos;bout the blue blue sky
[01:00.55]And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree
[01:07.23]I&apos;m turnin&apos; my head up and down
[01:10.59]I&apos;m turnin&apos; turnin&apos; turnin&apos; turnin&apos; turnin&apos; around
[01:13.69]And all that I can see is just another lemon tree
[01:20.06]Sing
[01:21.08]Dap-dadada-dadpm-didap-da
[01:26.16]Dadada-dadpm-didap-da
[01:29.87]Dap-didili-da
[01:34.37]I&apos;m sittin&apos; here I missed the power
[01:37.39]I&apos;d like to go out takin&apos; a shower
[01:40.89]But there&apos;s a heavy cloud inside my head
[01:44.19]I feel so tired put myself into bed
[01:47.25]Well nothing ever happens and I wonder
[01:55.08]Isolation is not good for me
[02:01.71]Isolation I don&apos;t want to sit on the lemon tree
[02:07.97]I&apos;m steppin&apos; around in the desert of joy
[02:11.17]Baby anyhow I&apos;ll get another toy
[02:14.17]And everything will happen and you wonder
[02:21.10]I wonder how I wonder why
[02:24.60]Yesterday you told me &apos;bout the blue blue sky
[02:27.56]And all that I can see is just another lemon tree
[02:34.56]I&apos;m turnin&apos; my head up and down
[02:37.93]I&apos;m turnin&apos; turnin&apos; turnin&apos; turnin&apos; turnin&apos; around
[02:40.92]And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree
[02:45.67]And I wonder wonder
[02:48.02]I wonder how I wonder why
[02:51.38]Yesterday you told me &apos;bout the blue blue sky
[02:54.43]And all that I can see and all that I can see
[03:01.25]And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree
